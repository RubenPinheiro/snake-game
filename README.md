# snake-game
an GUI project that replicates the classic snake game. The user controls the snake using the arrows keys and each time it hits the blue circle (food), a point is added in the scoreboard and the snake increases in size. If the snake hits the walls or hits its own tail, its game over. The project keeps track of the highest score through a .txt file that its refreshed everytime the user beats said score.

SKILLS:
  - use of classes
  - read and write a .txt file
